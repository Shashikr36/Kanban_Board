# Kanban Board Application

This **Kanban board application** is built using **React JS** and leverages the API provided by [QuickSell](https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment) to dynamically manage and organize tasks. The application enables users to efficiently handle tasks by grouping and sorting them based on their preferences, offering flexibility and control over their workflow. 

It also preserves the user's customized view even after a page reload, ensuring continuity in task management.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Grouping**: Organize tickets by **Status**, **User**, or **Priority** for better visualization and task management.
- **Advanced Sorting**: Sort tickets by **Priority** or **Title**, helping users prioritize tasks effectively.
- **Persistent View State**: Grouping and sorting options are saved in local storage, retaining user preferences even after reloading the page.
- **Priority Levels**: Tasks are assigned a priority value, helping users focus on what matters most:
  - **Urgent** (4)
  - **High** (3)
  - **Medium** (2)
  - **Low** (1)
  - **No Priority** (0)
- **Responsive UI**: The interface is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring seamless user experiences across devices.
